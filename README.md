# tree-sitter-macaulay2

A Tree-sitter grammar for the Macaulay2 programming language.

[Macaulay2](https://macaulay2.com) is a language and software system for research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.

[Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io) is an incremental parsing library used by editors and other tools to understand source code for features like syntax highlighting and navigation.

This project teaches Tree-sitter how to parse Macaulay2 source code.

⚠️ Work in progress.

## Playground

To open up a playground and parse Macaulay2 code:

```shell
npm run start
```

*Note:*  Use `google-chrome --enable-features=WebAssemblyUnlimitedSyncCompilation`
for this to work in Google Chrome.
